# DEPRECATED: Native Binary Releases
# 
# This workflow has been replaced with Docker-only releases.
# See: docker-release.yml for the new Docker release process.
# 
# QueryBird now uses GitHub Container Registry for distribution:
# - ghcr.io/trutohq/querybird:latest
# - ghcr.io/trutohq/querybird:v1.0.0
#
# Native binary releases are no longer supported.
# Use Docker deployment for all environments.
